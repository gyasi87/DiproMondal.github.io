                                <b>Hi</b>, my name is Nicholas Essel!
								London born, with a passion for understanding data and extracting as much information from it.
								
								I always thought my dream was to be a sales person! I enjoyed the uniqueness of everyday, speaking to different people and trying to understand their needs and what i could offer them. But I always felt myself gravitating back technology.
								From working in sales and business London, I was offered a job in Ghana as a Financial consultant. It felt like the next logical step in my career as I am originally from Ghana. There, I met my wife and after 3 years we decided to move to Sweden, where she is from.
								
								At first my main aim was to learn Swedish and was able to work as a warehouse manager in a music shop, where i was able to practice my Swedish in a work environment and indulge in another interest of mine, which is music. From there, I worked at a technology conference company, which seemed perfect for me. I got to sell and conversate with people in the tech industry. What could be greater right?!
								That's when I realised my true passion was in tech! I watched my first Python tutorial and i was hooked! Since then, I've completed numerous data science and machine learning courses, written a few trading bots and immersed myself fully into the data science world.
								
								As for my future, I hope to one day work as Senior Data Scientist and work with a diverse team

								In my free time I generally trade stocks, options and cryptocurrencies. I also like photoraphy and videography. I am very active in sports
								especially in football.
								
								I've focused mainly on Python, Git/GitHub, SQL but understand HTML, Node.JS and Solidity. I am enthusiastically looking into more programming languages I can integrate into the tech server i call my head.am an aspiring data scientist. I like everything about data - but my interests mainly involve
								extracting patterns from data (Data Mining), visualizing and presenting data in a easy to understand
								format (Data Visualization), analysing and understanding what the data can tell and foretell (Statistical
								Learning - Machine and Deep Learning).
